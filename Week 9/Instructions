Program: company.py
This program exercises many of the things we covered in this week’s material
including operator overloading and inheritance.
Requirements
For this assignment you have been provided a base class named Person contained
in the file person.py and a test program named test_company.py. For the
assignment you are to create a Python module named company.py that does the
following:
1. The module should import the Person class from person.py
2. The module should define two classes, Employee and Customer. Each class
should be derived from the Person class so it inherits a person’s attributes
and methods.
3. The Customer class should additionally:
a. Have an instance variable named credit_score, along with accessor
(“getter”) and mutator (“setter”) methods to read and set the credit
score.
b. Have a constructor with the following header that does the appropriate
initialization.
def __init__(self, name, address, phone, credit_score):
c. Override the __str__() method so it returns a string containing the
customer’s name, address, phone and credit score. For example, the
output may look as follows:
name: Drew Smith
address: 285 Andover Lane, Pompano Beach, FL, 33060
phone: 412-555-2121
credit_score: 760
4. The Employee class should additionally:
a. Have instance variables named badge (representing a badge number)
and salary, along with accessor (“getter”) and mutator (“setter”)
methods to read and set their values.
b. Have a constructor with the following header that does the appropriate
initialization.
def __init__(self, name, address, phone, badge, salary):
c. Override the __str__() method so it returns a string containing the
employee’s name, address, phone and badge number, but not their
salary. For example, the output may look as follows:
name: James Chen
address: 87 Pierce Road, Windsor, CT, 06095
phone: 256-555-3331
badge: 907
d. Have an __eq__ method that overrides the “==” operator. The criteria
for equality should be the badge number. (Note that you do not need
to override the __eq__ method for the Customer class.)
To download person.py and test_company.py from within Blackboard, right-click
on the respective file and select “Save link as…” Make sure to save the files to the
same folder you plan to write your company.py script in so the test_company.py
script will work and the person.py module will be found.
Testing
When you’ve developed your company.py module you should be able to run the
test_company.py script and see output similar to the following. Note that the exact
format of the output may vary, but the information should be the same.
Customers:
name: Drew Smith
address: 285 Andover Lane, Pompano Beach, FL, 33060
phone: 412-555-2121
credit_score: 760
Employees:
name: James Chen
address: 87 Pierce Road, Windsor, CT, 06095
phone: 256-555-3331
badge: 907
name: Brady Parker
address: 80 Franklin Dr., Waterbury, CT, 06705
phone: 756-555-3828
badge: 321
I found the employee with badge 321
