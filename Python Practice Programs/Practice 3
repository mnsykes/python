The following programming exercise makes use of the things we coved in this week's material. This
is a practice programming assignment and is not submitted for grading. However, you can ask
questions on this exercise just as you would with a graded exercise. Please use this week's
discussion board for questions (or send me email if the questions are specific to you and your
application). Enjoy!
Program: lines.py - Display requested lines in a file.
Write a program that allows the user to load a file and, repeatedly, display a line of their choice. The
program should:
1. Prompt the user for the name of the file to read/load.
2. The program should read each line of the file into a list (e.g. each element in the list is a
string containing the text of a line in the file)
3. The program should loop indefinitely and
a. Display the number of lines in the file
b. Prompt the user for the line number they would like to see
c. If the line number is 0, exit the program
d. If the line number is non-zero, display the appropriate line of text
e. If the line number is greater than the number of lines in the file, print an error and
continue, asking for another number.
4. Steps 1 & 2 above should be part of a function that prompts the user for the input file, opens
it, reads the file contents into a list and returns the list.
5. Step 3 should be included in a main() function.
Create and run this program as a Python script called lines.py and test it with a text file of your
choice.
