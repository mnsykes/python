The following programming exercise makes use of the things we coved in this week's material. This
is a practice programming assignment and is not submitted for grading. However, you can ask
questions on this exercise just as you would with a graded exercise. Please use this week's
discussion board for questions (or send me email if the questions are specific to you and your
application). Enjoy!
Program: customer.py – Create a class to model customer information.
Write a Python module called customer.py that defines a class called Customer. The class should:
1. Have three instance variables to hold the customer name, address and phone number.
2. Have a constructor (__init__ method) that accepts the name, address and phone number as
parameters and assigns them to the appropriate class instance variables.
3. Have separate methods to set the address and phone number, in case these change for the
customer. Note that you do not need a method to set the name since it is assume that will
not change.
4. Have separate methods to get the customer name, address and phone numbers.
5. Include a __str__ method that displays the customer information in the following form:
Name: Josh Kelly
Address: 7416 Monroe Ave., Media, PA, 19063
Phone: 424-555-4053
6. Once you’ve created your class, test it against the program test_customer.py to ensure it
functions. An example of correct output follows
Name: Josh Kelly
Address: 7416 Monroe Ave., Media, PA, 19063
Phone: 424-555-4053
Enter a new phone number for Josh Kelly: 424-555-8221
Josh's new number is 424-555-8221
Josh's new information is Name: Josh Kelly
Address: 7416 Monroe Ave., Media, PA, 19063
Phone: 424-555-8221
7. Write a test program of your own that verifies all the methods of the class work correctly.
